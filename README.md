## Model Details
The current clinical methods for preventing food impaction following the placement of fixed prostheses are largely subjective and empirical, resulting in a significant rate of missed diagnoses. Consequently, the development of an accurate and intelligent method for detecting food impaction is crucial to ensuring successful treatment outcomes for patients with tooth loss. We engaged in discussions with dental experts from various dental hospitals, who concurred that employing acoustic deep learning techniques for the detection of food impaction holds substantial practical value. This paper mainly focuses on the study of audio signals and corresponding spectrogram images to effectively standardize and improve the performance of food impaction detection in interproximal contact region.   



## Submission Status
Our work has been **submitted** and we will upload the corresponding code and database (https://github.com/xw-peking/FIAdataset) in the future and detail the flow of the code so that readers can copy it.  

Thank you for your interest in our work!
